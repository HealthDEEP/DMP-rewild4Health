# Project Description

**Title**: rewild4Health

**Full title**: Rewilding and reforestation-based solution for reducing zoonotic risk using a One Health approach

**Funder**: French National Research Agency (<a href="https://anr.fr/en/"target="_blank">ANR</a>)

**To**: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/healthdeep" target="_blank">IRL2021 HealthDEEP CNRS</a>

## Rational

Rewilding following reforestation could reduce zoonotic risk. The project rewild4Health takes place in northern Thailand characterized by a community reforestation policy. The project will be realized by the IRL2021 HealthDEEP (@tbl-persons).

## Research Objectives

The two main objectives of rewild4Health are:

\(1\) to assess the contribution of community reforestation to biodiversity through rewilding;

\(2\) to demonstrate that reforestation and rewilding are effective solutions to reduce the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases in a One Health approach.

The project rewild4Health is based on our previous research activities in Nan province (Thailand) @thinphovong2024protocol @thinphovong2023protected @chaisiri2023social.

## Summary

The three main research hypotheses of rewild4Health are:

\(1\) the effectiveness of community reforestation on biodiversity depends on the structure of community forests as well as community governance rules;

\(2\) rewilding contributes to the regulation of disease transmission with predators and specialist species capable of regulating synanthropic reservoir species;

\(3\) cross-sector collaboration (public health, animal health, conservation) and community engagement are key factors for ecological restoration and disease risk reduction through a One Health approach.

## Data organization

### Creators

-   **Identification of creators**

```{r codebook0, echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-creators
#| 
# tbl-cap: "Codebook for small mammal trapping: 0 - creators"

creator_file <- read.csv("/Users/serge/Documents/RQuarto/dataspice_rewild4Health/data/metadata/creators.csv")

# Print the codebook table using knitr::kable()
#knitr::kable(creator_file, format = "latex") |>
#  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 14, full_width = FALSE)

#gt(creator_file) |>
#  opt_table_lines() |>
#  tab_options(
#    table.background.color = "white",
#    column_labels.background.color = "white",
#    heading.background.color = "white",
#    table.font.size = px(14) 
#  )

if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::kable(
    creator_file,
    caption = "Codebook for small mammal trapping: 0 - creators",
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
} else {
  gt(creator_file) |>
    tab_options(table.font.size = px(14))
}

```

### File Naming Conventions

-   **Small mammals**

Small mammals are defined as non-flying mammals of Rodentia, Eulipotyphla and Scandatia (with body weight less than 1000 g).

Small mammals are trapped using live Live-traps, locally made, or commercial live-traps, such as sherman. Trapped animals are manipulated, sampled and released according to ethical approvement procedures.

Microchip (Passive Integrated Transponder: PIT Tag) is injected subcutaneously for individual identification during capture-mark-recapture session.

### Datasets and metadata

Three datasets are created:

(i) *Data of sensors (traps)*

```{r codebook n1, echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-sensors
#| 
# tbl-cap: "Codebook for small mammal trapping: 1 - sensors (traps)"

attributes_file <- read.csv("/Users/serge/Documents/RQuarto/dataspice_rewild4Health/data/metadata/attributes.csv") |>
  dplyr::filter(fileName == "traps.csv") |>
  dplyr::select(-fileName) |>
  dplyr::rename(dataType = unitText)  |>
  dplyr::rename(Description = description)  |>
  dplyr::rename(Variable = variableName)


if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::kable(
    attributes_file,
    caption = "Codebook for small mammal trapping: 1 - sensors (traps)",
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
} else {
  gt(attributes_file) |>
    tab_options(table.font.size = px(14))
}

```

(ii) *Data trapping location*

```{r codebook n2, echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-location
# tbl-cap: "Codebook for small mammal trapping: 2 - location"

attributes_file <- read.csv("/Users/serge/Documents/RQuarto/dataspice_rewild4Health/data/metadata/attributes.csv") |>
  dplyr::filter(fileName == "location.csv") |>
  dplyr::select(-fileName) |>

  dplyr::rename(Variable = variableName)



if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::kable(
    attributes_file,
    caption = "Codebook for small mammal trapping: 2 - location",
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
} else {
  gt(attributes_file) |>
    tab_options(table.font.size = px(14))
}
```

(iii) *Data small mammal individuals*

```{r codebook n3, echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-individuals

  dplyr::select(-fileName) |>
  dplyr::rename(dataType = unitText)  |>
  dplyr::rename(Description = description)  |>
  dplyr::rename(Variable = variableName)

# Print the codebook table using knitr::kable()
#knitr::kable(attributes_file, format = "latex")|>
#  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 14, full_width = FALSE)

#gt(attributes_file) |>
#  opt_table_lines() |>
#  tab_options(
#    table.background.color = "white",
#    column_labels.background.color = "white",
#    heading.background.color = "white",
#    table.font.size = px(14) 
#  )


if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::kable(
    attributes_file,
    caption = "Codebook for small mammal trapping: 3 - individuals",
    booktabs = TRUE
  )
} else {
  gt(creator_file) |>
    tab_options(table.font.size = px(14)) |>
    gt::tab_caption("Codebook for small mammal trapping: 2 - locations") |>
    gt::fmt_markdown(columns = everything()) 
    
}
```

### Folder Structure

**folder hierarchy with organizing data using dataspice** Below is the contents of directories in a tree-like format

```{r folder, echo=FALSE}
library(fs)
tree <- dir_tree(path  = "./dataspice_rewild4Health/", recurse = TRUE)
cat(paste0(tree, collapse = "\n"))

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Storage and Backup

**Storage Locations**

External hard drive dropbox mycore CNRS

**Backup Strategy**

Following any modification of a datafile:

1\. modify date in the name (e.g. data_name_yearmonthday)

2\. save the file in the dedicated hard drive and on mycore CNRS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Documentation

[Dataspice R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataspice/vignettes/overview.html) is used to create basic, lightweight, and concise metadata files. The basic files created include a README webpage.

The dataspice metadata fields are based on [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) and and other, richer metadata standards such as [Ecological Metadata Language](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/).

-   interviews: audio records confidential and deleted after transcription and anonymisation
-   human health: only aggregated data accessible

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

The principles of ethics and responsibility require local community and stakeholder engagement, such as in the Primary Health Care Unit, the District Public Health Office, and Nanthaburi National Park. Several meetings with all stakeholders helped to co-construct the project which made it possible to meet the objectives of human health, animal health, and biodiversity conservation.

### Informed Consent

Procedures for human health investigation, laboratory investigation, interviews, and questionnaires will be sent for approval by the ethical committee of the Nan Provincial Public Health Office, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. All participants who agree to join the study will be asked to read the Participant Information Form, which explains the objectives, procedures, possible risks, and benefits of the research project.

All data wil be anonymized to protect participant privacy

### Animal ethics and compliance

Procedures for collection of samples from domestic animals and wildlife, laboratory investigation, safety procedures, interviews and questionnaires of domestic animals owners will be sent for approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Kasetsart University. Rodent and other wildlife species that will be investigated by rewild4Health will be neither on the CITES list nor on the Red List (IUCN). Animals will be treated in accordance with the guidelines of the American Society of Mammalogists, and within the European Union legislation guidelines (Directive 86/609/EEC). Any trapped rodent species listed on CITES will be released without being manipulated. All animals will be released after sampling.

Approval notices for trapping and investigation of bats and rodents will be sent for approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Kasetsart University.

### Permit and compliance

Permit has to be approved by the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP) and the Royal Forest Department, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Thailand. In addition, foreign researchers participating in the research project have also o be approved by the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) with the consent of the DNP.
